## Project Description

SafeDash is an innovative web application that transforms dash cam accident footage into valuable NFTs while promoting road safety and providing tangible benefits to users. Our platform allows users to:

- Upload dash cam footage after accidents occur
- Convert footage into tradeable NFTs
- Access local discounts for car repairs and towing services
- Monitor real-time traffic conditions and accident reports
- Get immediate access to emergency services with precise GPS location sharing

The platform creates a unique ecosystem where accident documentation becomes a valuable asset, providing users with real-world benefits while contributing to road safety data collection.

### Key Features
- Secure video upload and NFT conversion
- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Local service provider discounts
- Emergency assistance integration
- NFT marketplace for trading benefits
- Interactive accident map

- Regional service provider networks that can be expanded independently
- Modular codebase allowing for easy feature additions

### Future Implementation Plans
1. **Enhanced Video Processing**
   - AI-powered accident scene analysis
   - Automatic damage assessment
   - Fraud detection system

2. **Expanded NFT Features**
   - Multiple NFT tiers with different benefit levels
   - Cross-platform NFT compatibility
   - Smart contract-based automatic discount redemption

3. **Mobile Applications**
   - Native iOS and Android apps
   - Direct dash cam integration
   - Offline video upload queue

4. **Service Provider Network**
   - Automated service provider onboarding
   - Real-time price comparison
   - Reputation system integration

## Additional Comments

### Current Limitations
- Video processing time can vary based on file size and server load
- Limited to specific geographical areas for service provider discounts
- Blockchain transaction fees may vary based on network conditions

### Known Issues
- Large video files (>500MB) may experience longer processing times
- Mobile browser compatibility is still being optimized
- Some service provider integrations require manual verification

### Security Measures
- End-to-end encryption for video uploads
- Secure blockchain transactions
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Regular security audits
